SWAG is a collection of repositories used to keep track of the metadata describing cloud accounts.  Originally built to store data on AWS, swag is flexible enough to be used for multiple providers (AWS, GCP, etc.,).

For applications that manage or deploy to several different accounts/environments SWAG provides a centralized metadata store.

Managing your cloud accounts with SWAG allows for consuming application to focus on business logic, removing hardcoded lists or properties from your application.

## Installation

swag-client is available on pypi:

```bash
    pip install swag_client
```


## Basic Usage
If no options are passed to the SWAGManager it is assumed that you are using the `file` backend and the `account` namespace.

```python
    from swag_client.backend import SWAGManager
    from swag_client.util import parse_swag_config_options

    swag_opts = {}
    swag = SWAGManager(**parse_swag_config_options(swag_opts))

    account = swag.get_by_name('account')
```

Configure SWAG by passing the client additional keyword arguments:

```python
    from swag_client.backend import SWAGManager
    from swag_client.util import parse_swag_config_options

    swag_opts = {
        'swag.type': 's3',
        'swag.bucket_name': s3_bucket_name
    }

    swag = SWAGManager(**parse_swag_config_options(swag_opts))
```

Additionally SWAG can be used a singleton, allowing a single instance (and it's cache) to be shared across an application.

Declare swag in a file like ``extensions.py``:
```
    from swag_client.backend import SWAGManager
    from swag_client.util import parse_swag_config_options

    swag = SWAGManager()
```


When you're ready to configure swag:
```
    from extensions import swag

    swag_opts = {
        'swag.type': 's3',
        'swag.bucket_name': s3_bucket_name
    }

    swag.configure(**parse_swag_config_options(swag_opts))
```


### Example Account JSON (v2)
Below is an example of the bare minimum JSON that will be created by SWAG with `schema_version=2`.

```
 [{
    "aliases": ["test"],
    "contacts": ["admins@test.net"],
    "description": "This is just a test.",
    "email": "test@example.net",
    "environment": "test",
    "id": "012345678910",
    "name": "testaccount",
    "owner": "ExampleCorp",
    "provider": "aws",
    "sensitive": false
 }]
```

Additionally SWAG has the ability to store metadata for `services` that may need to be tied to an account.

```
 [{
    "id": "012345678910",
    ...
    "services": [
        {
            "name": "myService",
            "metadata": {
                "name": "testService"
            },
            "status": [
                {
                    "region": "all",
                    "enabled": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
 }]
```

This service metadata for serving as a single source of truth for applications that have to routinely manage/monitor/process multiple accounts.


### Filtering

Regardless of backend, SWAG uses the `jmespath` syntax for filtering data.

```python
    swag.get("[?id=='012345678910']")  # valid jmespath filter
```

More information on jmespath filtering: http://jmespath.org/tutorial.html

### Old-style (deprecated)

SWAG also supports an older style calling convention. This convention only supports the S3 backend, additionally these functions are now deprecated and will be removed in the future.

```python
    from swag_client.swag import get_all_accounts
    get_all_accounts(bucket='your-swag-bucket').get('accounts')
```

or to filter by a service tag:

```python
    service = {'services': {'YOURSERVICE': {'enabled': True, 'randomflag': True}}}
    get_all_accounts(bucket='your-swag-bucket', **service).get('accounts')
```

## Versioning

All SWAG metadata is versioned. The most current version of the `account` metadata schema is `v2`. SWAG further provides the ability to transform data between schema version as necessary.

## Backends

SWAG supports multiple backends, included in the package are file, s3, and dynamodb backends. Additional backends can easily be created and integrated into SWAG.


#### Global Backend Options

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| swag.type | str | false | Type of backend to use (Default: 'file') |
| swag.namespace | str | false | Namespace for metadata (Default: 'accounts') |
| swag.schema_version | int | false | Schema version that will be returned to the caller. (Default: 'v2') |
| swag.cache_expires | int | false | Number of seconds to cache backend results (Default: 60) |

### S3 Backend

The S3 backend uses AWS S3 to SWAG metadata.

#### Backend Options

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| swag.bucket_name | str | true | Raw S3 bucket name |
| swag.data_file | str | false | Full S3 key of file |
| swag.region | str | false | Region the bucket exists in. (Default: us-east-1)


#### Permissions

IAM Permissions required:

```
    {
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
        "Effect": ["Allow"],
        "Resource: ["arn:aws:s3:::<swag-bucket-name>/<data-file>"]
    }
```

If you wish to update SWAG metadata you will also need the following permissions:

```
    {
        "Action": ["s3:PutObject"],
        "Effect": ["Allow"],
        "Resource: ["arn:aws:s3:::<swag-bucket-name>/<data-file>"]
    }
```


### File Backend
The file backend uses a file on the local filesystem. This backend is often useful for testing purposes but it not scalable to multiple clients.


#### Backend Options
| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| swag.data_dir | str | false | Directory to store data (Default: cwd()) |
| swag.data_file | str | false | Full path to data file |


### DynamoDB Backend
The DynamoDB backend leverages AWSs DynamoDB as a key value store for SWAG metadata.

SWAG expects a Dynamodb Table already exists.

Create a new table via the AWS console named `accounts` with a primary key of `id`.

#### Backend Options

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| swag.region | str | false | Region dynamodb table exists |

Note the above options except region is only needed if not SWAG table has been created.

#### Permissions

Minimum Permissions required:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DescribeQueryTable",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you wish SWAG to modify your table you will need the following additional permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PutUpdateDeleteTable",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```


### CLI Usage

Upon installation the swag_client creates a `swag` entrypoint which invokes the swag_client cli, example usage:

Examples:

```bash
    swag --help
```


### Extended SWAG Schema (Version 2)
The following describes the usage of all native fields included within the SWAG schema.


| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| schemaVersion | int | Describes the current schema version |
| id | str | Unique ID of the account |
| name | str | Canonical name, according to the account naming standard |
| contacts | list(str) | List of team DLs that are majority stakeholders for the account |
| provider | str | One of: AWS, GCP, Azure |
| type | str | See schema context for field validation |
| status | list(dict) | See status schema |
| services | list(dict) | See service schema |
| environment | str | See schema context for field validation |
| sensitive | bool |  Signifies if the account holds a special significance; (in scope for PCI, holds PII, contains sensitive key material, etc.,) |
| description | str | Brief description about the account's intended use. |
| owner | str | See schema context for field validation |
| aliases | list(str) | List of other names this account may be referred to as |

### Schmea Context for Field Validation
The V2 schema performs validation checks on certain fields to ensure values are within a defined list.  Some of these are optional and configurable to allow users to specify values that make sense for their use case.

The allowed values for `owner`, `environment` and `type` can be set during SWAGManager initialization by passing a `swag.schema_context` object as part of the swag_opts.

If you do not specify a schema_context entry for a field then any value is permitted.


```
swag_opts = {
    'swag.schema_context': {
        'owner': ['netflix', 'dvd', 'aws', 'third-party'],
        'environment': ['test', 'prod'],
        'type': ['billing', 'security', 'shared-service', 'service']
    }
}
```

#### Service Schema

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| name | str | Name of the service |
| regions | list(str) | List of regions - empty list indicates all regions |
| roles | list(dict) | List of roles that control access to this service. See role schema |
| metadata | dict | Service Level metadata


#### Status Schema

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| region | str | Status per-region |
| status | str | One of: Created, In-progress, Ready, Deprecated, In-active, Deleted |

| googleGroup | str | Corresponding google group |
| secondaryApprover | str | DL needed to approve role |


#### Definitions
##### Status

Created - Account has been created but infrastructure has not yet been established

In-progress - Account infrastructure is currently being deployed

Ready - Account is ready for deployment

Deprecated - Account has been marked as deprecated, no new services should be deployed into this account

In-active - Account has been evacuated of all services

Deleted - Account has been marked as deleted

##### Type
Billing Account(s) - The billing account in a multiple account architecture provides a central account for billing aggregation across the environment. Typically, no AWS resources (e.g. instances) run in the billing account.

Security Account(s) - The security account in a multiple account architecture provides environments for central log collection and analysis (e.g. CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs) and security monitoring (e.g. configuration monitoring with Security Monkey, active security scanning and testing with other tools).

Shared Service Account(s) - Shared service accounts provide infrastructure, data, and services across the organization. All service/resource accounts will typically have network connectivity to shared service accounts.

Service/Resource Account Groups - Service/resource account groups host the bulk of systems and applications. Account groups are created based on various dimensions and will typically have production and test elements (separate accounts). Service/resource accounts may optionally have connectivity to other service/resource accounts.

See [sample_accounts.json](https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/swag-client/blob/masVxter/sample_accounts.json) an example of the current json data created by SWAG.
